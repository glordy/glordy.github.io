                                                            An oval face is symmetrical and generally longer than a circular face.

                                                            Throw out your oversized frames that will throw off facial symmetry.

                                                            Opt for any style that covers below the eyebrow to the top of the cheekbone

                                                            A square face has a broad forehead and prominent jaw line.

                                                            Steer clear of frames with harsh angles that will segment facial features.

                                                            Look at aviators, butterfly, or any other circular frames.

                                                            Stay away from circular frames that will make the face seem extra round.

                                                            Turn to rectangular, square, wrap, or shield frames to add dimensions to the face.

                                                            It is important to avoid oversized or teardrop shaped frames that will hide facial features.

                                                            Instead, try shield, aviator, rimless, or shield frames to highlight the face shape.
