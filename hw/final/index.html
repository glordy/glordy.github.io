                                                            Wednesday. My hair gets completely ruined, my clothes become uncomfortably wet, and yeah I may have fallen down the stairs in front of everyone a couple days ago. The whole scene is a mess. So how do I deal with Southern Florida’s
                                                            unpredictable weather? How do I keep the rain from ruining my day? (I’m not going to lie, it still ruins my day… but, I have a few tips below to make the experience a little less annoying.)

                                                            packed a rain jacket in my backpack. I didn’t want to wear it all morning and look like an idiot, as it was 84 degrees without a cloud in the sky.

                                                            In 1929 sunglasses dramatically shifted from “prescription” eyewear protecting celebrities from paparazzi flashes to an everyday fashion accessory. The first sunglasses in the 30s and 40s were minimalistic round frames. However, in the
                                                            50s, icons such as Audrey Hepburn and Grace Kelly sported a new style: the cat eye, which became extremely popular. After the 50s, brands experimented with different shapes and colors from the bright neons of the 60s to the dark edgy
                                                            frames of the 80s. Recently, we have turned back to tiny sunnies, a nostalgic look popularized in the 90s. But how do these changes become mainstream trends?

                                                            In the past, the fashion savvy may have had to read gossip magazines or seen movies to learn about what celebrities were wearing, but now it is as simple as opening a social media app. Celebrities and social media influencers alike have
                                                            the power to affect the public’s views based on their posts. “I definitely think that social media and seeing sunglasses around campus has not only influenced my taste in sunglasses but inspired me to go out of my comfort zone to try new
                                                            things.” said Haley Lanzoni, co-host of Behind the Seams on UMTV Pulse. Her favorite trend of 2018 was small sunglasses with a brow bar on top, not only because it was featured on models such as the Hadids, but also because it fit her
                                                            face shape. Senior Emma Erickson Kerry also agreed that Instagram is where she felt most inspired by accounts such as hypebeasts and hypebae. “I think Instagram is the best place to find trends whether it’s for a major person in the
                                                            fashion industry like Virgil Abloh or a small influencer who just has amazing style.” Her go-to trend is also tiny sunglasses because it evokes a 90s streetwear vibe that she tries to emulate in her day-to-day style.
                                                            According Morline Cadet, manager of Sunglass Hut at Lincoln Mall, most customers have a designer or style of frame they have in mind when they go shopping, but end up with something completely different. “Sometimes I’ll have women come in
                                                            wanting small Prada sunglasses, but they leave with Rayban aviators because that’s what looks better on their face shape.” Cadet said. She believes that sunglass shopping is less about what looks good on models and influencers and is more
                                                            about complementary shapes that enhance one’s facial features. “Ray Ban, Chanel, Prada, and Micheal Kors are our top selling designers, but there is no one shape fits all.” she said.

                                                            So what trends are to be expected this year? In 2019, patterns aren’t just for your clothes. This year, there will be many brands, like Fendi and Moschino, that are taking on creative and unusual patterns for their frames. Bedazzled
                                                            sunnies are also on the come-up after Dolce & Gabbana sent their models out in glasses with pearls and jewels. Featured on runways of designers such as Tom Ford, Gucci, Miu Miu, futuristic shield lenses are set to hit the market in the
                                                            spring. This sporty frame is frameless and will be polarized for protective purposes and non-polarized to be worn as an accessory.

                                                            High end fashion designers have always been key sunglass trendsetters with the looks they feature in their runway shows. However, there are near identical dupes on websites such as Pretty Little Things, Quay and Fashion Nova, which are a
                                                            mere fraction of the original’s price. Remember the tiny frames Millie Bobby Brown wore on SNL? The original pair by Roberi and Fraud are almost $200! Yet there is a quality look alike on Amazon for $12. Sunglass trends come and go so
                                                            quickly that it isn’t always practical to spend lots of money on the latest style.

                                                            If you are going to host an afternoon tea, it might as well be “insta-worthy.” A crisp tablecloth is the perfect way to start setting up your table to create a nice, clean space. An added bonus is that it protects the table from your
                                                            clumsy friend who is bound to have at least one spill. Next, you’ll want to place a small tea plate in the center of the space with a small salad fork on the left and a butterknife on the right of the plate. The teacup should sit on a
                                                            saucer on the right upper corner of the plate with the handle facing the right at a three o’clock position. While this may seem weird, it actually makes it easier to enjoy the tea because the handle won’t get in the way of the other items
                                                            on the table. The teaspoon can either sit on the saucer behind the teacup, the round part on the left facing up, or to the right of the knife. The napkin should be placed on the left of the fork and the fold should face the outside so the
                                                            open corner faces the plate. This makes sure that you can grab, open, and place it on your lap in one swooping motion. If you are using place cards, set it at the top of the plate and put the pastry fork directly behind it with the prongs
                                                            facing the right. The teapot should be above the teacup with the handle facing the left.The jam and cream dishes are set on the left of the plate. Finally, the sugar, milk and sugar tongs are placed in the center above the plate and the
                                                            sugar bowl on the right of the plate. This should be close to the hostesses seat because it is customary for the person throwing the party to pour the first glass of tea. Feel free to add floral arrangements around the beautiful setting

                                                            <b>Sleep</b>

                                                            Even though you may want to pound down another energy drink to cram for finals, sleep actually helps you retain the information you’re studying and stay energized.

                                                            Sleep has also been proven to help your body fight off infections and reduce anxiety and stress.

                                                            I get it! Your friend may have just ordered a new Starbucks holiday latte and you want a sip. Don’t do it. Your friend may be sick and not be showing symptoms just yet.

                                                            You don’t want to get someone’s germs because you couldn’t resist sharing something.

                                                            It is important to sanitize your hands after every class because you don’t know who is sitting in your seat before you and what kind of germs they may have.

                                                            Also, make sure you are cleaning your room every so often so dust and allergens don’t get trapped, making you feel sick.

                                                            Dehydration causes headaches and fatigue, which could seriously distract you from getting your work done. It is recommended to drink 64 oz. per day.
