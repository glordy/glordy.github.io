                                                            Nothing is better than waking up early, taking a shower, straightening your hair, putting on your makeup, basically being a functioning human being, only to walk outside to rain. This has happened to me twice this week and it’s only
                                                            Wednesday. My hair gets completely ruined, my clothes become uncomfortably wet, and yeah I may have fallen down the stairs in front of everyone a couple days ago. The whole scene is a mess. So how do I deal with Southern Florida’s
                                                            unpredictable weather? How do I keep the rain from ruining my day? (I’m not going to lie, it still ruins my day… but, I have a few tips below to make the experience a little less annoying.)

                                                            Check a weather app
                                                            Looking out your window isn’t always that helpful. Yesterday, it was completely sunny and gorgeous until the monsoon hit at 1:12 in the afternoon. Luckily, I checked my weather app and knew this seemingly sudden downpour was coming and
                                                            packed a rain jacket in my backpack. I didn’t want to wear it all morning and look like an idiot, as it was 84 degrees without a cloud in the sky.

                                                            Invest in rain boots
                                                            Flip flops have no grip and so it’s way easier to fall on your face or slip in a puddle on your way to class. Having shoes with traction is a lifesaver because, well, you aren’t worried about getting hurt. Or you can always wear my
                                                            personal favorite alternative: Crocs. No giblets. (Trust me, it’s a look. And everyone will comment on them, so you’ll be pretty popular all day.)

                                                            Wear shorts
                                                            For the love of all things good in this world, do not wear leggings or jeans or any type of long pants if you know it’s going to rain. One time I made this mistake and wore leggings in the middle of torrential rain and had to sit in my
                                                            soaking wet leggings the entire hour and fifteen minutes, feeling like I had wet my pants. There was no escape. If you are wearing shorts, it’s great because you just have to wipe your bare legs off to dry. Boom. Not wet or freezing.

                                                            A square face has a broad forehead and prominent jaw line.

                                                            Steer clear of frames with harsh angles that will segment facial features.

                                                            Look at aviators, butterfly, or any other circular frames.

                                                            Stay away from circular frames that will make the face seem extra round.

                                                            Turn to rectangular, square, wrap, or shield frames to add dimensions to the face.

                                                            It is important to avoid oversized or teardrop shaped frames that will hide facial features.

                                                            Instead, try shield, aviator, rimless, or shield frames to highlight the face shape.
