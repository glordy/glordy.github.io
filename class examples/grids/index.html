                                                  <p class="g2-text-1">In 1929 sunglasses dramatically shifted from “prescription” eyewear protecting celebrities from paparazzi flashes to an everyday fashion accessory. The first sunglasses in the 30s and 40s were minimalistic round frames.
                                                            However, in the 50s, icons such as Audrey Hepburn and Grace Kelly sported a new style: the cat eye, which became extremely popular. After the 50s, brands experimented with different shapes and colors from the bright neons of the 60s to
                                                            the dark edgy frames of the 80s. Recently, we have turned back to tiny sunnies, a nostalgic look popularized in the 90s. </p>

                                                  <p class="g3-text">Square
                                                            A square face has a broad forehead and prominent jaw line.
                                                            Avoid: frames with harsh angles that will segment facial features
                                                            Try: aviators, butterfly, or any other circular frames

                                                            Circle
                                                            A circular face has less defined angles.
                                                            Avoid: circular frames that will make the face seem extra round
                                                            Try: rectangular, square, wrap, or shield frames to add dimensions to the face

                                                            Heart
                                                            A heart shaped face is widest at the temples and narrowest at the chin.
                                                            Avoid: oversized or teardrop shaped frames that will hide facial features
                                                            Try: shield, aviator, rimless, or shield frames to highlight the face shape

                                                            Oval
                                                            An oval face is symmetrical and generally longer than a circular face.
                                                            Avoid: oversized frames that will throw off facial symmetry
                                                            Try: any style that covers below the eyebrow to the top of the cheekbone

                                                  <img class="g4-img" src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" alt="placeholder pic">
                                                  <p class="g4-text">In the past, the fashion savvy may have had to read gossip magazines or seen movies to learn about what celebrities were wearing, but now it is as simple as opening a social media app. Celebrities and social media
                                                            influencers alike have the power to affect the public’s views based on their posts. “I definitely think that social media and seeing sunglasses around campus has not only influenced my taste in sunglasses but inspired me to go out of my
                                                            comfort zone to try new things.” said Haley Lanzoni, co-host of Behind the Seams on UMTV Pulse. Her favorite trend of 2018 was small sunglasses with a brow bar on top, not only because it was featured on models such as the Hadids, but
                                                            also because it fit her face shape. Senior Emma Erickson Kerry also agreed that Instagram is where she felt most inspired by accounts such as hypebeasts and hypebae. “I think Instagram is the best place to find trends whether it’s for a
                                                            major person in the fashion industry like Virgil Abloh or a small influencer who just has amazing style.” Her go-to trend is also tiny sunglasses because it evokes a 90s streetwear vibe that she tries to emulate in her day-to-day style.
                                                            According Morline Cadet, manager of Sunglass Hut at Lincoln Mall, most customers have a designer or style of frame they have in mind when they go shopping, but end up with something completely different. “Sometimes I’ll have women come in
                                                            wanting small Prada sunglasses, but they leave with Rayban aviators because that’s what looks better on their face shape.” Cadet said. She believes that sunglass shopping is less about what looks good on models and influencers and is more
                                                            about complementary shapes that enhance one’s facial features. “Ray Ban, Chanel, Prada, and Micheal Kors are our top selling designers, but there is no one shape fits all.” she said.
                                                            So what trends are to be expected this year? In 2019, patterns aren’t just for your clothes. This year, there will be many brands, like Fendi and Moschino, that are taking on creative and unusual patterns for their frames. Bedazzled
                                                            sunnies are also on the come-up after Dolce & Gabbana sent their models out in glasses with pearls and jewels. Featured on runways of designers such as Tom Ford, Gucci, Miu Miu, futuristic shield lenses are set to hit the market in the
                                                            spring. This sporty frame is frameless and will be polarized for protective purposes and non-polarized to be worn as an accessory.
                                                            High end fashion designers have always been key sunglass trendsetters with the looks they feature in their runway shows. However, there are near identical dupes on websites such as Pretty Little Things, Quay and Fashion Nova, which are a
                                                            mere fraction of the original’s price. Remember the tiny frames Millie Bobby Brown wore on SNL? The original pair by Roberi and Fraud are almost $200! Yet there is a quality look alike on Amazon for $12. Sunglass trends come and go so
                                                            quickly that it isn’t always practical to spend lots of money on the latest style.
