                                                            An oval face is symmetrical and generally longer than a circular face.
                                                            Avoid: oversized frames that will throw off facial symmetry
                                                            Try: any style that covers below the eyebrow to the top of the cheekbone

                                                            Avoid: frames with harsh angles that will segment facial features
                                                            Try: aviators, butterfly, or any other circular frames

                                                            Avoid: circular frames that will make the face seem extra round
                                                            Try: rectangular, square, wrap, or shield frames to add dimensions to the face

                                                            Avoid: oversized or teardrop shaped frames that will hide facial features
