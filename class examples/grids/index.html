                                                  <p class="g2-text-1">In 1929 sunglasses dramatically shifted from “prescription” eyewear protecting celebrities from paparazzi flashes to an everyday fashion accessory. The first sunglasses in the 30s and 40s were minimalistic round frames.
                                                            However, in the 50s, icons such as Audrey Hepburn and Grace Kelly sported a new style: the cat eye, which became extremely popular. After the 50s, brands experimented with different shapes and colors from the bright neons of the 60s to
                                                            the dark edgy frames of the 80s. Recently, we have turned back to tiny sunnies, a nostalgic look popularized in the 90s. </p>

                                                  <p class="g3-text">Square
                                                            A square face has a broad forehead and prominent jaw line.
                                                            Avoid: frames with harsh angles that will segment facial features
                                                            Try: aviators, butterfly, or any other circular frames

                                                            Circle
                                                            A circular face has less defined angles.
                                                            Avoid: circular frames that will make the face seem extra round
                                                            Try: rectangular, square, wrap, or shield frames to add dimensions to the face

                                                            Heart
                                                            A heart shaped face is widest at the temples and narrowest at the chin.
                                                            Avoid: oversized or teardrop shaped frames that will hide facial features
                                                            Try: shield, aviator, rimless, or shield frames to highlight the face shape

                                                            Oval
                                                            An oval face is symmetrical and generally longer than a circular face.
                                                            Avoid: oversized frames that will throw off facial symmetry
                                                            Try: any style that covers below the eyebrow to the top of the cheekbone
